# Tourism-Website
Natours is a beautiful travel website (desktop site) with stunning use of gradients, colors, shapes and hover effects. Made without a single framework, it demonstrates the power of vanilla css and html. Learned the use of sass and 7-1 architecture to boost modularity and bem methodology for proper naming conventions that improve readability.
